I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor (expected 2025). My research
interests are in development and labor economics generally, with current research on labor inspections in Brazil and
child marriage in Indonesia.

Iâ€™m originally from Jakarta, Indonesia and moved to the U.S to pursue my undergaduate studies. I completed with a BS in
Economics from University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked at Cornell University and
Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University as a research assistant.
